Shipping Policy
Our products are shipped from our warehouses in South Africa (the shipping warehouse depends on the stock of the model you have purchased). It is quite possible that your order is shipped from a warehouse located in another country because the model ordered was only available there at the time of ordering. As the logistics are automated by software via Shopify, everything is done automatically to speed up the processing of your order. We carry out weekly stock checks to ensure that the quality of our products is as high as possible.

Current Shipping Conditions: Due to a recent surge in demand and ongoing supply chain challenges, shipping times may be slightly extended. We kindly ask for your patience and understanding as we navigate these circumstances. Please expect an additional 1-3 business days to standard delivery times. Estimated shipping times will be provided at checkout.

The products offered on this website are intended for sale, delivery, and use within South Africa.

Any attempt to place an order destined for a restricted territory will be automatically refused or cancelled.

This website, its content, offers, and pricing are intended exclusively for consumers located in South Africa and other authorized territories.

By accessing this website, you acknowledge that you are a resident of South Africa or an authorized territory and agree not to attempt to have our products delivered to any restricted territory.

Delivery time is between 5 and 10 working days, depending on where you live (excluding weekends, public holidays and unforeseen delays due to carriers).

This does not include a processing time of 1 to 3 working days. During sales periods, or if the product is in high demand, the processing time may reach 7 to 10 working days.

Delivery times are approximate and depend on the location of your country, your post office and customs practices.

You will be responsible for paying any customs duties or additional charges required by your government or post office.

We will address your item exactly as you have specified. Once the product reaches the destination country, your local post office will distribute the item for delivery. It is the customer's responsibility to contact your local post office for any problems that may arise after our product arrives in the destination nation.

If you are ordering from South Africa, you will receive a tracking code as soon as your order is shipped. If the tracking is not updated for a few days, don't worry, there may be a one or two day delay.

Goods are imported on behalf of the consignee/buyer. The consignee authorizes BioEdge™ to import the goods on their behalf. The consignee/buyer accepts that BioEdge™ may delegate the obligation to import the goods on its behalf to a subcontractor. The recipient will pay all taxes and customs duties in addition to the purchase price of the goods.

Returned packages for which the sender is not responsible may be reshipped at the customer's expense. Refunds for returned packages that are not the shipper's fault will be made in full, less shipping costs incurred by the shipper.

If you are shipping an item, you should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We do not guarantee that we will receive the returned item.
